Havent uploaded the data file, so to run the code you have to move the; 
train, val, test and LIAR datasets into a subfolder of Feedforward_model.py
This folder should be called data

to train the Feedforward model:
>> python3 main.py

to only test, on either test set
>> python3 main.py --test_only

or LIAR set:
>> python testing_liar.py --test_only

Kept the feedforward_model.py for now for refference, but not needed
