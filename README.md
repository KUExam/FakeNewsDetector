Feedforward neural network:

This neural network was created using the argparse library, so you can run test_only and train_only, including visualize_model to get the visualizations of the model

to train and test the Feedforward model:
>> python3 main.py

to only train:
>> python3 your_script.py --train_only

to only test on the original test set:
>> python3 main.py --test_only

to test on LIAR set:
>> python3 main.py --test_only --new_data_file data/train_liar_update.csv
